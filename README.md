### Cloning Repos ###

It's useful to create a folder to hold all the repos (projects), but well, optional:

* mkdir arena
* cd arena

Then If you'll work on the transactional or observability aspects behind Arena, you must download the following projects:

* hg clone https://bitbucket.org/uqbar-project/apo-core
* hg clone https://bitbucket.org/uqbar-project/apo-poo
* hg clone https://bitbucket.org/uqbar-project/apo-pot
* hg clone https://bitbucket.org/uqbar-project/apo-parent

Then all Arena projects:

* hg clone https://bitbucket.org/uqbar-project/uqbar-domain
* hg clone https://bitbucket.org/uqbar-project/arena-core
* hg clone https://bitbucket.org/uqbar-project/arena-jface
