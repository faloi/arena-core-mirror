Transformations

 When you bind two properties usually a transformation is needed to adapt them.
 This is achieved using a Transformer. 
 This is allways the case if you bind properties of different types, 
 but also you can use a Transformer in order to adapt two different formats of Strings.

* Built-in transformations

  Arena automatically provides some built in transformations. 
  Also these transformations are inferred from the type of the properties, 
  so they are automatically inserted into your bindings.

  The built-in transformations are:

 * Any primitive Java type (boolean, byte, short, char, int, long, float, double)
   to its corresponding wrapper object
   (Boolean, Byte, Short, Character, Integer, Long, Float, Double). 
   For example, primitive int's are transformed into java.lang.Integer's
   
 * String's to both primitive types and their corresponding wrapper objects.
   For example, a String can be transformed both to an int or to a Integer
   
 * Between different integer number types, including 
   primitive types (also char), 
   wrappers (also Character) 
   and java.math.BigInteger 
 
 * Between different floating point types, including
   primitive types, wrappers and java.math.BigDecimal 
   
 * Between java.util.Date and java.lang.String
 * Between java.math.BigInteger and java.lang.String
 
 * Any Object can be transformed into to a String using its toString() method.
 
 * A bit more specific: org.eclipse.core.runtime.IStatus objects 
   can be transformed to Strings
 
* Writing custom transformers
  
  Besides the built-in transformations there are cases where you need to customize this in order to work with your own domain objects (mostly value objects).
  That can be done extending Arena by implementing the Transformer interface.

  Here is an example Transformer for BigDecimal objects, written in XTend. 
  
  []  

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
class BigDecimalTransformer implements Transformer<BigDecimal, String> {

	override getModelType() {
		BigDecimal
	}

	override getViewType() {
		String
	}

	override modelToView(BigDecimal valueFromModel) {
		valueFromModel.toString
	}

	override viewToModel(String valueFromView) {
		if (valueFromView == "")
			null
		else
			try
				new BigDecimal(valueFromView)
			catch (NumberFormatException e)
				throw new UserException("El valor ingresado debe ser un n√∫mero", e)

	}
}
